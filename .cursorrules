# Cursor Rules for This Project

## Import Rules
- ALWAYS use `import type { ... }` when importing types from any file (e.g., `./types.ts` or `@/types/*`).
- Never use value imports (`import { Foo }`) for pure types—prefer inline style: `import type { Foo } from './types'`.
- If a file exports only types, enforce `import type` exclusively. Fix any violations on save or edit.

## File Generation Rules
- NEVER generate or suggest creating `.md` files for explanations, docs, refactors, or any inline edits.
- Do not auto-save chats or outputs as Markdown—keep everything in code files or console.
- Delete any existinggenerated Markdown files after saving the code file.
- If documentation is needed, suggest adding JSDoc/TS Doc comments inline instead of separate files.

## General
- Prioritize TypeScript best practices: strict mode, no-any, explicit types.
- Be concise in responses; explain only when asked.
- Respect ESLint/Prettier configs—run fixes automatically where possible.
